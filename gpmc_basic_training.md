# Motivation and goal
Every year new undergrad, masters and doctoral students join our [Marketing and Consumption Research Lab - GPMC][8ace6f75]. The undergrads usually stay for a short period of time -- one or two semesters --  while developing their final work. On the contrary, masters students stay at least two years and doctoral students, on average, four years and a half. In this document I try to give an advice to the doctoral students about how, in my view, they can achieve excelence in their academic course. Despite being focused on the doctoral students, this text may also be helpfull to masters or even undergrad student who want to take the most of their respective courses.

During their academic courses, all researchers need to acquire theoretical and methodological knowledge, take courses, write research proposals, pass qualification and project exams and, if everything goes well, defend their dissertation at the end of four and a half years, sometimes more.

It is impossible to suggest an unique set of theoretical knowledge that will be equally relevant to every student. However, there are many tools that facilitate everyone's academic work that most students -- specially thouse who are taking a _stricto sensu_ path -- should learn in academia. Many of the tools I will describe can be helpfull for both the students' theoretical and methodological evolution (that I label as **Basic Tools**). These **Basic Tools** are:

- programming languages
- reference managers
- version control
- how to manage files
- tools to manage and work with research teams

**Theoretical tools:**

- bibliometric packages

**Data Science tools:**

- best training websites

However, before diving into these more concrete tools, I will start by introducing what, in my perspective, is a successfull doctoral path.

# How to develop a successfull doctoral trajectory
It is hard to summarize what is a successfull doctoral trajectory. However, it is not difficult to sinthesize the results a successfull doctoral students should achieve at the end of their courses:

  - they should take as many theoretical and methodological courses possible in the first two years. The first two years of the course are the momment when the students should expose themselves to different theoretical and methodological perspectives. This exposition will help them to decide their preferred theories and methods that will be guide their work after the doctoral course.
  - at the end of the first year, they should start to reduce the list of possible theories, methods, and subjects of study
  - also at the end of the first year, they should define who will be their advisor
  - at the end of the third semester, they should write a theoretical manuscript sinthesizing the theory about their chosen research subject
- before the thesis defense, they should have, at least, 3 research papers about their research's subject and/or research method approved or under review in good academic journals
